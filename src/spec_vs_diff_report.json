  "summary": "Diff adds backend fields/migration for review documents (contentType, pros/cons arrays, rating) and introduces frontend utilities plus CreateReviewPage UI/state to capture and save these fields. However, the requested editor-toolbar dropdown and robust load/restore behavior for existing documents are not evidenced, and some added logic (rating normalization/clamping) goes beyond stated requirements.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure backend create/save and fetch/query APIs persist and return contentType/pros/cons/rating with safe defaults when missing (news / [] / [] / 0).",
      "reason": "The diff shows type changes and a migration, but does not show the actual backend API functions (create/save/fetch/query) being updated to apply defaults on read/write for older records (or to guarantee non-null values in returned frontend types). backend/main.mo is truncated before any relevant API implementations.",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "In the document editor UI, provide a dropdown in the top toolbar with exactly two options (News/Review), default News, persisted per document and reflected when loading.",
      "reason": "The only evidenced UI change is a contentType select on CreateReviewPage; there is no evidence of a dropdown in the editor top toolbar, nor evidence it is wired to load an existing document and reflect stored contentType.",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Conditionally render Pros/Cons/Rating fields outside the rich-text editor only when contentType=review; hide for news; render/hide immediately on dropdown change and correctly on load.",
      "reason": "CreateReviewPage defines state for pros/cons/rating and computes isReviewType, but the JSX where these fields are conditionally rendered is truncated, and there is no evidence of load behavior for an existing saved document.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Persist Pros/Cons/Rating on save and restore them on load; pros/cons stored as arrays; frontend must serialize/deserialize deterministically (textarea <-> array).",
      "reason": "Saving path is partially evidenced (textareaToArray used on submit), but there is no evidence of restoring pros/cons/rating into the form when loading an existing document, and no evidence that arrayToTextarea is used anywhere for deserialization/population.",
