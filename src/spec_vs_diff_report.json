  "summary": "Frontend pages/routes for bike detail, brands index/detail, and a manage-bikes page were added, along with a BikeForm and search UX that surfaces matching brands. Backend Bike type was extended with priceRange/images/details and a migration module was added and wired via a conditional migration clause. However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that the backend exposes the required authenticated bike CRUD methods (create/update/delete + ownership/admin checks) or that the required placeholder image asset was added.",
