  "summary": "REQ-2 appears addressed by changes to the global header (palette-related navigation/UI removed). REQ-1 (Create Bike submission fix + clear error messaging + automatic list refresh) cannot be confirmed from the provided truncated diffs; the key createBike mutation wiring, backend createBike handling, and specific UI error replacement for “action not available” are not evidenced.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the Create Bike flow so that clicking the “Create Bike” submit button successfully creates a new bike entry and the new bike appears in the user’s bike list (Manage Bikes page) instead of showing an “action not available” error.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not show the actual createBike call path being corrected (frontend mutation + backend method), nor evidence that the generic “action not available” error is replaced with a clear, cause-specific message while keeping the form open on failure. ManageBikesPage shows an invalidate on form close, but there’s no visible evidence that the form is closed only on success and that failures keep it open with a specific message.",
