  "summary": "REQ-1 appears to be implemented in the markdown specs parser via more flexible MSRP key matching and a more robust price-range extractor. REQ-2 has a new edit dialog component and state-update handler, but the diff summary does not clearly show the swatch click wiring/state needed to open the edit UI and save per-swatch edits on the Section Palettes page.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Clicking an existing displayed palette color opens an edit UI and saving replaces only that clicked color entry (with hex validation/normalization), while keeping remove-color working.",
      "reason": "A dialog component and an edit handler are added, but the shown (truncated) SectionPalettesPage snippet does not provide evidence of the required UI wiring: rendering swatches as clickable elements that open the dialog, tracking which swatch is being edited, and invoking the save to replace only that entry.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "If no price row is present, existing price inputs remain unchanged when applying pasted Markdown.",
      "reason": "The parser returns optional minPrice/maxPrice, but the diff summary does not include the BikeForm 'Paste Specs' Apply logic that decides whether to overwrite existing Min/Max Price inputs when minPrice/maxPrice are undefined.",
